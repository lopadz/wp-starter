## File Structure
If you're not a fan of the [template hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/) in WP, give this theme a try! Using conditional logic and custom functions like **wps_get_file()** you can load any file you want plus a few more tricks (like passing data to the included file ðŸ˜€).

### Terminology
If needed, you can still load templates the "normal way" to override the theme. But, if you're a rebel, here's a brief explanation of the terminology being used:

- **Components** (SCSS): Basic repeatable presentation elements (_banners, cards, etc..._)
  
- **Modules** (PHP - ACF): Repeatable sections that contain components (_columns, carousel, top banner, etc..._)

- **Partials** (PHP): Repeatable blocks of content (_header, footer, hero module, etc..._) 

- **Layouts** (PHP): Groups of partials and/or modules (_page, 404, archive, etc..._)

- **Templates** (PHP - WP): Same as WP to keep things consistent with backend. (_Homepage, Layout Builder, Sidebar Left, etc..._)
